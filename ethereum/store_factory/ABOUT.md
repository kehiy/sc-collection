# Store Factory

The StoreFactory contract allows you to deploy some [KeyValueStore](../keyval_store/KeyValueStore.sol) contract and keep track of them by a map and set or get data from them by providing the name and key/value. that's something like a manager for them.

The purpose of this contract is having an example of creating contracts in another contract and calling function from them.
