## Jetton's

The jetton standard is a good way to implement tokens on blockchain. The most bad thing about Jetton's is that if you are sending Jetton to a new account that doesn't have the jetton wallet you need to pay the fee for contract creation since there is contract/actor/account per token for each account. that mean some child contract keep track of the state of this jetton.
